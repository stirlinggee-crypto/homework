    <h3 class="box">This period marks the end of the Paleozoic Era. It was a time when all major landmasses assembled into the supercontinent Pangaea, leading to a drier climate.</h4>
    <br>
    <h3 class="box">The air had so much oxygen (around 35% compared to today's 21%) that bugs grew huge! You could find millipedes as big as crocodiles and dragonflies with wingspans over two feet.</h4>
    <br>
    <h3 class="box">Amphibians ruled the land, and the first reptiles appeared, with skin and eggs that let them live away from water.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3 class="box">There was no grass or flowering plants back then, just giant trees and ferns.</h3>
