    <h3 class="box">When the period started, most mammals were only as big as rodents. By the end, they evolved into huge creatures like the Paraceratherium, a hornless rhino that was the largest land mammal ever—as tall as a two-story building!</h4>
    <br>
    <h3 class="box">During this time, early ancestors of whales were small, four-legged land animals that slowly adapted to living in the ocean, so once whales walked.</h4>
    <br>
    <h3 class="box">Since there weren't many large predators yet, giant flightless "Terror Birds" ruled the land. Some stood up to 10 feet tall with massive, bone-crushing beaks.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3 class="box">Early ancestors of modern animals like dogs, cats, horses, and even monkeys first appeared during this period. </h3>
