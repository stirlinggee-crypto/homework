    <h3 class="box">Toward the end of the Neogene, the first early human ancestors (hominins) appeared in Africa.</h3>

    <h3 class="box">The most significant geographic event was the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, which connected North and South America for the first time. This allowed animals to migrate between the two continents in an event called the "Great American Faunal Interchange". </h3>
